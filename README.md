# RobloxAccountManager
a python app that creates a json file in its folder. it saves data you add by asking for the accounts username, password, level, and money (can be changed varying on game).
I made this so i can level up accounts in games and sell the accounts so its made for bloxfruits bc those people have no life but it can be modified for any use :)
# How To Use
just run it EXCEPT.. add the full path to ur json file at DATA_FILE = ""
